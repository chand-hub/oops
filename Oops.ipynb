        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that helps developers create robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. It's a fundamental concept that helps create objects with similar characteristics and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "-> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity or concept. It has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe its characteristics and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-> Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of exposing only the essential features of an object or system while hiding the internal details. It focuses on defining an interface or a contract that specifies what an object can do, without revealing how it's done.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and its associated methods that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class or object. It helps hide the internal implementation details and protects the data from external interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "-> Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores (__) on either side of the method name. These methods are used to define custom behavior for operators, functions, and other built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "-> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit the properties, methods, and behavior of another class. The inheriting class, called the subclass or derived class, inherits the characteristics of the parent class, called the superclass or base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own unique way.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "-> Encapsulation is achieved in Python through the use of classes and objects. Python provides several ways to encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
        "9. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> 1. Modularity: OOP allows developers to break down complex systems into smaller, independent modules (classes and objects) that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.\n",
        "2. Reusability: OOP enables developers to create reusable code by defining classes and objects that can be used in multiple contexts, reducing code duplication and improving productivity.\n",
        "3. Flexibility: OOP provides flexibility in programming by allowing developers to create objects that can adapt to different situations and requirements, making it easier to modify or extend existing code.\n",
        "4. Easier maintenance: OOP makes it easier to maintain and modify existing code by providing a clear and organized structure, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or errors.\n",
        "5. Improved readability: OOP promotes code readability by providing a clear and concise way to define classes, objects, and relationships, making it easier for developers to understand and work with complex systems.\n",
        "10.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-> Class Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Shared by all instances: Class variables are shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "2. Defined at the class level: Class variables are defined at the class level, outside of any method.\n",
        "3. Accessed using the class name: Class variables can be accessed using the class name or an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Unique to each instance: Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class.\n",
        "2. Defined at the instance level: Instance variables are defined at the instance level, typically in the __init__ method.\n",
        "3. Accessed using the instance name: Instance variables are accessed using the instance name.\n",
        "11.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "-> Multiple inheritance is a feature of Python that allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes. This means that a child class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, combining their functionality.\n",
        "12. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in PythonH.\n",
        "-> __str__ and __repr__ Methods in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are two special methods that are used to represent objects as strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Human-readable representation: The __str__ method returns a human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "2. Used for display purposes: __str__ is used when you want to display an object in a user-friendly way, such as when printing an object.\n",
        "3. Should be readable and concise: The string returned by __str__ should be readable and concise, providing a clear understanding of the object's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__ Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Unambiguous representation: The __repr__ method returns an unambiguous string representation of an object, which can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "2. Used for debugging purposes: __repr__ is used when you want to get a detailed and accurate representation of an object, such as when debugging.\n",
        "3. Should be a valid Python expression: The string returned by __repr__ should be a valid Python expression that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "-> The super() function in Python is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class. It returns a temporary object of the superclass that allows access to methods and properties of the parent class.\n",
        "14. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "-> The __del__ method in Python is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is also known as a finalizer or destructor.\n",
        "15. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "-> @staticmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. No access to class or instance: A static method has no access to the class or instance it is called on.\n",
        "2. No self or cls parameter: A static method does not take a self or cls parameter.\n",
        "3. Useful for utility functions: Static methods are useful for defining utility functions that belong to a class but do not depend on the class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Access to class: A class method has access to the class it is called on.\n",
        "2. cls parameter: A class method takes a cls parameter that refers to the class.\n",
        "3. Useful for alternative constructors: Class methods are useful for defining alternative constructors or methods that operate on the class level.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-> Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Python, polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance, where a subclass inherits the properties and methods of a parent class and can also add new properties and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "-> Method chaining is a programming technique in Python where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line of code. This is achieved by returning the object itself (self) from each method, allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "-> The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an object to be called as a function. This method is invoked when an object is used as a callable, such as when it's called with parentheses ().\n",
